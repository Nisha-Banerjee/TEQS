# TEQS

Welcome to The Eigensolver Quantum School, a crash course designed by students for students. The aim of this program is to take someone who has no QC knowledge and put through a five day crash course that puts them in the frame of mind necessary to learn via formal texts such as Nielsen and Chuang (which is the prize of our two day hackathon!) 

## TEQS Prerequisites
One of the beauties behind learning quantum computing is that on an elementary level, very few pre-requisites are required. At TEQS, the course is designed in a way where the only pre-requisites required are basic linear algebra and classical information processing. To ensure that everyone has those under their belts before attending the crash course, we made those three notebooks which we encourage everyone to read and solve the exercises. 

 - [Chapter 1](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS/blob/main/Pre-requisites/Chapter%201%20-%20Math%20Tools%20I%20(Vectors%2C%20Complex%20Numbers%20and%20Dirac%20Notation).ipynb) is on vectors and how they are used to represent the state of a qubit
 - [Chapter 2](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS/blob/main/Pre-requisites/Chapter%202%20-%20Math%20Tools%20II%20(Linear%20Operators).ipynb) is on operators and how they are used to manipulate the state of a qubit
 - [Chapter 3](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS/blob/main/Pre-requisites/Chapter%203%20-%20Classical%20Computation%20and%20Logic.ipynb) is on Classical Information and Boolean Logic

## Hackathon!


Welcome to the Eigensolvers Quantum School Hackathon! In the notebook found in this folder there are 4 problems covering all the material covered in the lectures. These problems have been designed for people coming from all different levels of experience in quantum computing. You will get a different certificate level based on the problems you completed:

- First two: Beginner
- First three: Intermediate
- All four: Advanced

There are also prizes for the winners of the hackathon:

- First Place: RasQberry - Premium
- Second Place: RasQberry - All Inclusive
- Third Place: RasQberry - Customizable DIY Kit
- Fourth Place: Nielsen and Chuang

The ranking will be based on the weighted cost of the solutions for problem 3 and problem 4; as defined in the notebook. 

To submit your solutions, fill out the form below, with the code that you write for each problem.
https://forms.gle/KkA6gBbhrCZpWgnX8

The deadline for submission is Sunday (July 11th) 7pm Indian Standard Time. Remember, the ultimate goal is to have fun and learn some quantum computing while you're at it. All the best!
